# High Performance Computing Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises, examples, and experiments developed as part of a Durham University course on **High Performance Computing (HPC)**. The materials are intended to demonstrate core concepts, programming models, and performance considerations used in modern parallel and high-performance systems.

## Contents

The repository includes:
- Parallel programming exercises (e.g. MPI, OpenMP)
- Performance analysis and optimization tasks
- Scalability and benchmarking experiments
- Coursework directory with reports
- Supporting scripts, build files, and documentation

Each exercise is typically organized in its own directory with relevant source code and instructions.

## Objectives

The main goals of this repository are to:
- Gain hands-on experience with parallel and distributed computing
- Understand performance trade-offs in HPC applications
- Learn to write, analyze, and optimize high-performance code

## Requirements

Depending on the exercise, you may need:
- A Linux-based system or HPC cluster
- Compilers such as `gcc`, `mpicc`, or vendor-specific compilers
- HPC libraries and tools (e.g. MPI, OpenMP)
- Job schedulers (e.g. Slurm) for cluster-based runs

Specific requirements are documented within individual exercise folders.

## Usage

Clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in each exercise directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <exercise-directory>
