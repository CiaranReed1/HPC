Plan of action:
-make script to test speed and append to a file, at the same time need to check for correctness
-parallelise simple functions with omp. investigate difference between collapse and non collapse
-run strong scaling tests
-parallelise harder functions, check for correctness
-perform strong scaling on hamilton up to 128 processes
-do this for maybe 2 problem sizes and investigate if any difference
-use python to create strong scaling plot 
-create report detailing the parallelisation strategy, maths for speedup, results
