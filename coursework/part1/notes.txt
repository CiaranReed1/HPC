Plan of action:
-make script to test speed and append to a file, at the same time need to check for correctness
-parallelise simple functions with omp. investigate difference between collapse and non collapse
-run strong scaling tests
-parallelise harder functions, check for correctness
-perform strong scaling on hamilton up to 128 processes
-do this for maybe 2 problem sizes and investigate if any difference
-use python to create strong scaling plot 
-create report detailing the parallelisation strategy, maths for speedup, results  


Development Notes:
-Made initial speed and correctness tests, ran the serial speed test on hamilton and recorded the inital benchmark.
-Made script for strong scaling tests, made a makefile to clean up all files from these tests. 
-Added initial parallel clauses to Init, step and norm. I will run the speed tests on these

Init:
-Given that u and v are linear lists, it might be worth finding the max value of index and doing only 1 iteration over that. 
-this is similar to doing a collapse but with potentially less overhad, this is worth testing for
-for now, just implement with the basic for. 

Step:
-Very similar situation to Init with regards to collapse

Norm:
-Easily parallelised using a for reduction clause, but again like step and init it could be potentially be improved by making a 1d array
