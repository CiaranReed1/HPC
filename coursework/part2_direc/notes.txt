Development Notes:
-We can do a n (ranks) x 1 grid, breaking down the vertical (i) direction into tall slabs of width N and height M/n. 
After each function there will need to be n*2 -2 messages sent to update the whole system. I will implement this first
-created sub M and sub N to give the dimensions of the each ranks
-defined first i and last i to be the indicies of the first and last points (not ghost cells), note all ranks will have ghost cells at the top and bottom
-using my knowledge from mpi-heat, using send recv is probably the best way to implement halo exchanges, will start with that

-for norm i will initially implement with an all reduce, but it should be noted that doing with a single reduce might be better and should be tested
