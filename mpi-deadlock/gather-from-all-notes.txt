Using gather from all, i notice the blocking gather is significantly, and consistently slower than the non blocking gather. 
When increasing the number of messages i also notice that the blocking time and the non blocking time both increase. I will run and calculate an average to work out what is happening

Running on hamilton with 64 cores over a range of message sizes it is clear the non blocking is faster, especially for larger message sizes.
For smaller messages it is slower to use non blocking, likely due to the overhead of the non blocking. 
If combined with adding computing whilst waiting on the receives then it will be obviosuly much better!!!
