As far as splitting a u[M][N][O] with O = N > M onto 4 processess. I guess it depends on the speed of the computation compared to the speed of sending messages.
If sending messages takes a long time, then it would be better to do more heavy computation on each process and send the least amount of messages. 
Similarly if messages take little time then it would be better to send more frequent messages? 

We could split 4x1x1, or 2x2x1. The first being 4 hoirzontal "Slabs" that are relatively short (height) bit  wide and long
 the second being 4 long cuboids in a grid

Taking the 4x1x1, Each process would have an [M/4 + 2][N][O] array, +2 for boundary exchanges. (only 1 needed on top and bottom) 
we would again only need 6 memory transfers, each of a 2d plane of size NxO up and below. This would be a large transfer,
but MPI is built for large bandwidth messages. so this is exactly the use case for this. 
The actual computation would be contiguous in memory as it is split along the slowest axis. So the computation would be fast.
