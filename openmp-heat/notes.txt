By adding a pll for loop to the init we can parallelise this function. However it wasnt a particularly demanding function.
It is only called once at the start of the program so it yields very few benefits in terms of speedup. 

I only saw significant speedups using parallel after i implemented the coloring. nothing else made  a big difference, and parallelising the base was actually detrimental
Adding the ghost cell boundary conditions increased the number of iterations substantially. It would be hard to compare performance as we are comparing two different simulations at this point
